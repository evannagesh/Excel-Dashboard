# Excel-Dashboard
The raw dataset can be viewed on one of the sheets.  I edited it to make the Working Sheet by removing duplicates, adding age brackets using a nested if function and making a few other minor formatting changes to make the data easier to interpret for viewers.  I subsequently made three pivot tables to visualize certain demographic trends in the purchasing data.  I copied them and formatted them on a different sheet.  Lastly, I inserted slicers to make the dashboard interactive so that viewers can examine the effect of other key demographic information that I did not use in making my pivot tables.
